# Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis of tweets from twitter and movie reviews using the IMDB Dataset that contains over 250,000 movie reviews.
Used the IMDB dataset to fine-tune a DistilBERT model that is able to classify whether a movie review is positive or negative. For training I used the Trainer API which is used to optimize fine tuned Hugging face transformers like DistilBERT. Pytorch was used with its built in NLP to understand whether it was a positive or a negative response.
